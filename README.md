# COMP 426 Final Project Rubric
For the final project of COMP 426, you and your group will design and implement a fully-featured, professional, full-stack web application. Your project will fall into one of two categories. 

## Website
Solves a problem or provides a service.
A well designed front end that is easy to use and visually pleasing.
A backend API that utilizes a database of your choosing. 

## Game
A UI for the game.
A backend that allows online play/competition in some way utilizing a database of your choosing.
Entirely built from web components written by you (no loading UE or Unity or other game engines).

If you have an idea that doesn’t seem to fit into one of these categories, please contact chrisbur@cs.unc.edu before going ahead with your proposal. If your idea is good it will be added as a category above. 

Below is a rubric of the required components that must be submitted.

## Proposal   due September 29th
Submit a typed, single-spaced write-up no more than one page in length describing the application your group plans to develop. Describe how your idea will meet the functionality requirements listed below. This is not a contract, and it’s okay if your final project ends up changing after you submit your proposal. We just want you to have given it some thought. This will be graded for completion and is a requirement in order to have the rest of your project considered.

## Mockup   due October 14th 
Upload a screenshot or gif showing the current state of your app and a link to the GitHub repo your group uses to host your code. It does not need to be functional or even significantly developed---we just want to see that you have started. This will be graded for completion and is a requirement in order to have the rest of your project considered.


## 15%  Video due November 22nd
Upload a video (unlisted is fine) to YouTube demonstrating the functionality of your website. The first few minutes of the video should be somewhat of an elevator pitch or commercial meant to “sell” your product to potential customers. The rest of your video should be a technical deep dive showing off your work and how you implemented things. Your video must be no longer than 20 minutes and must include the following elements:

Identify your target user/customer
Identify the issue that your app solves
Explain how your app solves the problem
Demonstrate the main functionality of your website/product

These are minimum requirements; you are encouraged to be creative.

## 15%   Presentation / Expo due November 24th
This portion of the grade will come from attending the expo during the final exam period at the end of the semester. This will be similar to a poster presentation session at an academic conference (but online!). The exam period is three hours long starting at 4 pm, and you must attend for the whole three hours. You will register a Zoom meeting on a shared google doc where you will present and answer questions about your work for a one hour period. You must have a visual aid prepared and linked next to your zoom meeting.  Ideas for visual aids could include a PowerPoint/Google Slides, user experience flow chart, or screenshot diagram. During the remaining two hours, you will be required to give feedback to the students presenting at that time. More details will be given about the expo towards the end of the semester.


## 40%   Functionality
At a minimum, your completed app must implement the following features: 

Fully accessible from the world wide web (other students and instructors will be visiting them)
Compatible with chromium-based browsers
Your app must have a signup process that allows users to create accounts and log in using username/email and password. The app should store additional information about each user besides username and password.
Your app must create, read, update, and delete from the backend you create.
An HTML input field where, as a user types, autocomplete suggestions are displayed. This widget must implement debouncing, and must be a useful part of the application.
Your app must access a dynamic data source (your backend) to generate content and not solely rely on static content (e.g. hard-coded HTML pages).
Your app must consume a 3rd party API. You are free to choose any publicly available API you wish.

Meeting these minimum functionality requirements will only guarantee a 40% grade on your final project. 

If one of these requirements make no sense for the project you are working on, confirm they are not required for your project, and then don’t do them. The last thing we want is a great website that has a contrived feature that is out of place. We will expect you to make up the skipped work somewhere else. 

## 30%   Design
Does the website look and behave well? This refers not only to the aesthetic appearance of the site but also the structure and usability of the pages. The website should look and behave like a professional, modern web app. In particular, it should provide a pleasant user experience and demonstrate good design fundamentals.

The backend demonstrates good software design principles. The API is modern and easy to consume. The API should be documented and viewable.
